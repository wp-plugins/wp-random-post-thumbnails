# WP Random Post Thumbnails

Allows you to upload images to be used as random images for posts.  This plugin shows one of the uploaded images as the featured image for a post (if the post doesn't have one attached already). Useful if your theme shows thumbnails for the posts, and you don't want any posts without images.

I submitted this plugin to Wordpress.org and I'm currently waiting on approval.  I hope it gets approved!

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-random-thumbnails` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by going to Settings > Random Post Thumbnails.
4. That's it! :)
